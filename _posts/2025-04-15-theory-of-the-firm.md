> *“We define an agency relationship as a contract under which one or more persons (the principals) engage another person (the agent) to perform some service on their behalf which involves delegating some decision making authority to the agent.”*  
> — Jensen & Meckling (1976)

Welcome to another episode of **Law and Economics for Startups**, where we take the classics of corporate finance theory and ask: what does this mean for you, the scrappy founder trying to raise a pre-seed round without accidentally giving your co-founder’s cousin a permanent board seat?

Today’s text: Jensen and Meckling’s “Theory of the Firm.” It’s a 1976 banger about agency costs — the frictions that arise when the people who *own* a company (you, your investors) aren’t the same as the people who *run* it (still you… but also maybe that VP of Sales you just hired off LinkedIn).

### The core idea: Equity isn’t just about control

Startups often treat equity like the only thing it affects is voting rights. “If I give away 20%, I still have 51%, so I’m fine.” But Jensen and Meckling point out that ownership creates a *bundle of incentives* — and breaking that bundle (i.e., raising money) introduces **monitoring costs**, **bonding costs**, and **residual losses**.

## 👀 Four scenarios where this gets real

Let’s break this down using four startup funding scenarios.

---

### 1. The Friends & Family Round SAFE

You’re raising $50k in SAFEs at a $5M cap. It’s your aunt, your college roommate, and your former boss. Nobody’s asking for a board seat.

> *“The costs of the agency relationship include… the monitoring expenditures by the principal, the bonding expenditures by the agent, and the residual loss.”*

At this stage, the agency costs are low because *monitoring* is basically non-existent. Aunt Linda isn’t checking your burn rate in Carta. But here’s the kicker: that doesn’t mean the costs are zero — just that they’re deferred.

**Lesson:** The equity you’re giving away now may feel cheap because there’s no oversight — but when you hit Series A, Aunt Linda becomes a ghost on your cap table with meaningful dilution power and no accountability. Monitoring will come. Just later, and possibly harder.

---

### 2. The Early-Stage Fund That Just Wants “Visibility”

A $250k SAFE from a micro-VC, still uncapped because they’re “founder-friendly.” But they do want “quarterly updates,” “access to the data room,” and a “quick sync” with your lead engineer.

> *“Monitoring expenditures are incurred by the principal to limit the aberrant activities of the agent…”*

This is what Jensen and Meckling warned you about. Visibility isn’t free. Monitoring means time. Time means opportunity cost. And that costs you — not in voting rights, but in speed.

**Lesson:** Control isn’t the only cost of equity. Monitoring costs are the hidden tax of raising from people who *care.* Sometimes that’s good. Sometimes it’s a full-time job.

---

### 3. The Lead Investor with the Right to Approve a Sale

It’s a $1.5M priced seed round. You get a board. You get a cap table with two more columns. Your term sheet includes protective provisions, including approval rights on M&A.

> *“It pays the owner of the firm to spend resources to limit divergences from his interest by the agent…”*

Here, the investors are explicitly limiting your discretion. And they’re doing it with *contractual rights*, not just oversight. This is a bonding cost — you’re signaling that you won’t do dumb things with their money… by agreeing to handcuff yourself.

**Lesson:** Think of control provisions like self-imposed curfews. They’re the bonding expenditures in disguise. You’re not just selling equity. You’re buying constraints.

---

### 4. The Founder Who Keeps 100% and Just... Burns Out

You didn’t raise anything. You own it all. You’re proud. And you’re now also: CEO, CTO, head of sales, office manager, and the person who has to email Stripe when your webhook breaks.

> *“When the manager is the owner of the entire residual claim... there is no agency cost of equity.”*

Beautiful in theory. Exhausting in practice. Yes, there are no monitoring or bonding costs — because you’re the only one in the room. But that doesn’t mean there are no costs. In fact, the entire firm is now *dependent on your utility function.*

**Lesson:** Pure ownership avoids agency costs, but introduces burnout costs — which are *not* covered in the paper, but should be.

---

## 🤯 So where do SAFEs come in?

SAFEs delay the moment when agency costs kick in. They’re **not** equity yet. But they **will be**. And founders often forget that the monitoring and bonding behavior of investors doesn’t wait for conversion.

SAFE holders:
- Can’t vote... but can email you weekly.
- Don’t have rights... but still expect updates.
- Don’t sit on the board... but talk to your co-founder more than you do.

They’re like Schrödinger's Principals: both active and passive depending on the round.

---

## TL;DR: Equity is a contract. And contracts have costs.

Agency costs aren’t just abstract finance theory — they’re your next Monday morning. Equity means incentives. Incentives mean oversight. And oversight, even from the chillest YC alum turned angel, comes with a cost.

So the next time you’re about to hit “send” on that DocuSign SAFE at 2am, maybe ask yourself: who’s the principal now?
