# State of Pre-Seed: 2024 in Review

Last year began as a promising one for growth in the pre-seed marketâ€”so how did it end up?  
We have all the key trends on SAFEs, convertible notes, dilution, and much more.

## Q4 Highlights

Early-stage startup founders and operators entered 2024 with bated breath, hoping that the fundraising environment would rebound. Now that the dust has settled, how did the year shape up for those at the earliest stages of the venture ecosystem?

## Surge Then Plateau

Although 2024 began as a promising year for growth in the pre-seed market, with quarterly increases in total cash raised in Q1 and Q2, it ended rather anticlimactically.

## SAFE Notes vs Convertible Notes

Investors increasingly favored post-money SAFEs over convertible notes in 2024, reversing trends from previous years.

## Dilution Trends

Average dilution for first-time founders crept up slightly as round sizes increased, even in down-market conditions.
